## Part 2: Affiliate Program Research

### 🟢 Confirmed Affiliate Programs

---

#### 1. Clio — Channel Partner / Affiliate Program

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Program Name** | Clio Channel Partner Program (Affiliate tier) |
| **Application URL** | https://www.clio.com/partnerships/channel-partners/become-a-partner/ |
| **Lead Submission URL** | https://www.clio.com/partnerships/channel-partners/submit-a-lead/ |
| **Commission Structure** | Not publicly disclosed — revealed after approval. Industry reports suggest 15–25% of first-year ARR or flat fee per conversion. |
| **Cookie Duration** | Not publicly disclosed (direct program) |
| **Payout Terms** | Negotiated upon approval |
| **Network** | Direct (Clio manages internally) |
| **Approval Requirements** | Fill out form — no traffic minimum stated. Takes minutes. |
| **Status** | ✅ Open to All |
| **Estimated Value** | HIGH — most-searched product on CounselStack |

**Notes:** Clio's affiliate program is a "no strings attached" referral program. You apply, get a referral code, and submit leads via a form. You can also progress to Certified Partner for higher commissions and dedicated support. Since commission rates aren't published, the true potential is unknown — but with Clio being the dominant brand, this should be your #1 application.

---

#### 2. MyCase — 8am™ Consultant Program (PartnerStack)

|--------|------|
| **Program Name** | 8am™ MyCase Consultant Program |
| **Application URL** | https://market.partnerstack.com/page/mycase |

---

#### 3. PracticePanther — Affiliate/Referral Program (PartnerStack)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Program Name** | PracticePanther Referral Partner Program |

---

#### 4. CosmoLex — Refer-A-Friend + Channel Partner

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Program Name (Simple)** | CosmoLex Refer-A-Friend |
| **Application URL** | https://www.cosmolex.com/referrals/ |
| **Commission Structure** | **$150 gift card** per paying customer referred |
| **Payout Terms** | Gift card (Amazon/Visa) per verified conversion |
| **Network** | Direct |
| **Approval Requirements** | Just submit a form — no requirements |

| **Channel Partner URL** | https://partners.cosmolex.com/ |
| **Channel Commission** | Quarterly payments; amount disclosed after signed agreement |
| **Estimated Value Per Referral** | $150 flat |

**Notes:** The simple refer-a-friend ($150/referral) is the fastest path to money. The channel partner program pays more but requires a signed agreement and certification. Start with the referral form, then negotiate the channel program after some conversions.

---

#### 5. Lawmatics — Affiliate Partner Program

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Program Name** | Lawmatics Affiliate Partnership |
| **Application URL** | https://www.lawmatics.com/partners/affiliate |
| **Commission Structure** | **10% of Annual Contract Value** at the 90-day mark |
| **Cookie Duration** | Not published (direct program) |
| **Payout Terms** | Paid at 90-day mark after referral signs (not upon trial) |
| **Network** | Direct |

**Notes:** Lawmatics is the premium legal CRM/intake platform. At $99–149/user/month, even a solo attorney signup is worth $119–$179 commission. The 90-day hold period is longer than most programs — plan your cash flow accordingly.

---

#### 6. TimeSolv — Affiliate Program

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Program Name** | TimeSolv Affiliate Program |
| **Application URL** | https://www.timesolv.com/affiliate/ |
| **Commission Structure** | **$50 per qualified lead** (paid at lead stage, not after conversion) |
| **Cookie Duration** | Standard tracking link duration |
| **Payout Terms** | Per qualified lead |
| **Network** | Direct |
| **Approval Requirements** | Website/blog with relevant audience |
| **Status** | ✅ Open to Publishers |
| **Estimated Value Per Lead** | $50 flat |

**Notes:** TimeSolv pays at the "qualified lead" stage, not post-conversion. This means you get paid earlier but the per-conversion value is lower. High-volume billing content could generate consistent $50 payouts. Note: TimeSolv is part of ProfitSolv (same parent as Rocket Matter).

---

#### 7. Bill4Time — Publisher Affiliate Program

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Program Name** | Bill4Time Publisher Affiliate Program |
| **Application URL** | https://www.bill4time.com/affiliates/publishers/ |
| **Commission Structure** | "Significant finder's fee" — exact % not published; apply to get terms |
| **Cookie Duration** | Standard tracking (HasOffers platform) |
| **Payout Terms** | Via HasOffers affiliate portal |
| **Network** | Direct (HasOffers tracking) |
| **Approval Requirements** | Website/blog audience — open to publishers |
| **Status** | ✅ Open to Publishers |
| **Estimated Value** | Unknown until approved — likely $30-100 per conversion |

**Notes:** Bill4Time has two program types: publisher (you) and consultant (law firm advisors). The publisher program is designed for blogs and content creators. Given Bill4Time's price point ($27–80/user/month), commission will be modest but consistent from billing-focused content.

---

#### 8. Smokeball — Customer Referral Program

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Program Name** | Smokeball Referral Program |
| **Application URL** | https://www.smokeball.com/referral-program |
| **Commission Structure** | **$300 eGift card** when referred contact signs up |
| **Cookie Duration** | N/A (form submission, not tracking link) |
| **Payout Terms** | eGift card upon signup |
| **Network** | Direct |
| **Approval Requirements** | Existing Smokeball customer OR general submission |
| **Status** | ✅ Open (primarily for customers/advocates) |
| **Estimated Value Per Referral** | $300 flat |

**Notes:** This is primarily a customer referral program, not a traditional publisher affiliate program. However, the form-based submission may work for leads generated from content. Worth submitting if you drive clear Smokeball trial intent. Consider reaching out to their partnerships team to negotiate a proper affiliate arrangement — Smokeball's $300+ per signup makes it worth pursuing.

---

#### 9. Rocket Matter — Certified Experts Program

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Program Name** | Rocket Matter Certified Experts & Consultants Program |
| **Application URL** | https://www.rocketmatter.com/partners/ |
| **Commission Structure** | Revenue sharing — exact % negotiated on approval |
| **Payout Terms** | Revenue share (monthly or quarterly, TBD on approval) |
| **Network** | Direct |
| **Approval Requirements** | Consultant/expert positioning preferred; application reviewed |
| **Status** | ✅ Open (Application-Based) |
| **Estimated Value** | Unknown until approved |

**Notes:** Rocket Matter positions this as a consultant partnership, not a standard affiliate program. If you publish as a legal tech expert/reviewer, you likely qualify. Revenue share programs without published rates can be negotiated — position CounselStack as a legal tech publication to get better rates.

---

#### 10. NetDocuments — Partner Program

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Program Name** | NetDocuments ISV/Referral Partner Program |
| **Application URL** | https://www.netdocuments.com/partners/partner-program/ |
| **Commission Structure** | Not publicly disclosed; paid quarterly; no commission loss per program page |
| **Payout Terms** | Quarterly |
| **Network** | Direct (Salesforce-based partner portal) |
| **Approval Requirements** | Application required; legal tech publisher may qualify |
| **Status** | ⚠️ Application-Based (Selective) |
| **Estimated Value** | Unknown — NetDocuments is $55-99/user/month, so even 10% is significant |

**Notes:** NetDocuments targets larger firms ($55-99/user/month, often 10-50 users). Even one referral converting could be worth $500-$1,000+ in commission. Worth applying if you have content driving document management searches.

2. Select the program
3. Click "Links" → "Generate new link"
4. Optionally set a campaign tag (e.g., `?via=counselstack-review`)
5. Copy the link — this is your affiliate URL

**For Direct programs (Clio, Lawmatics, etc.):**
- You'll receive a unique referral code or URL upon approval
- Some programs use UTM parameters on their website URL
- Save all links in a spreadsheet with the program name

---

### Step 5: Adding Affiliate Links to the Codebase

**Primary Location:** `/app/for/_data/audiences.ts` — the `affiliateUrl` field already exists!

The `SoftwareRecommendation` interface already has `affiliateUrl: string`. You just need to replace the placeholder URLs with your actual tracking links.

**Current state** (placeholder URLs):
```typescript
affiliateUrl: "https://www.clio.com",
```

**Updated state** (with tracking links):
```typescript
// app/for/_data/audiences.ts
{
  name: "Clio",
  affiliateUrl: "https://www.clio.com/?ref=counselstack", // Replace with Clio referral code URL
  ...
}
```

**For software.ts** (reviews page), add `affiliateUrl` to the `SoftwareReview` interface:
```typescript
// app/software/_data/software.ts — PROPOSED ADDITION
export interface SoftwareReview {
  slug: string;
  name: string;
  // ... existing fields ...
  affiliateUrl?: string; // ADD THIS FIELD
}
```

Then add URLs to each software entry:
```typescript
clio: {
  slug: "clio",
  name: "Clio",
  affiliateUrl: "https://www.clio.com/?ref=YOUR_REFERRAL_CODE", // Clio referral
  website: "https://www.clio.com",
  ...
}

mycase: {
  slug: "mycase", 
  affiliateUrl: "https://partnerstack.com/link/mycase/YOUR_TRACKING_LINK",
  ...
}

practicepanther: {
  slug: "practicepanther",
  affiliateUrl: "https://partnerstack.com/link/practicepanther/YOUR_TRACKING_LINK",
  ...
}
```

**For comparisons.ts**, update platformA/platformB to add affiliate context:
```typescript
// Example: Update comparison pages to use affiliate links on CTAs
// In your comparison component, pass affiliateUrl from the software data
// and use it on "Try [Software]" or "Get Started" buttons
```

**File locations to update after approval:**

| File | What to Update |
|------|----------------|
| `app/for/_data/audiences.ts` | `affiliateUrl` field in `topRecommendations` |
| `app/software/_data/software.ts` | Add `affiliateUrl?` field and values |
| `app/vs/_data/comparisons.ts` | Add affiliate links to CTA sections |
| `app/use-case/_data/usecases.ts` | Add affiliate links to `solutions` entries |

---

### Step 6: Disclosure Requirement

**⚠️ REQUIRED: FTC Affiliate Disclosure**

Add this to your site header or footer:
```
"CounselStack may earn a commission when you purchase software through our links. 
This never affects our reviews or recommendations."
```

Add disclosure to each review/comparison page:
```typescript
// Component example
const AffiliateDisclosure = () => (
  <div className="affiliate-disclosure">
    <small>
      💼 Affiliate disclosure: We may earn a commission if you subscribe to software 
      through our links. This does not influence our recommendations.
    </small>
  </div>
);
```

---

## Part 5: Tracking Dashboard Setup

### Option A: Google Analytics 4 (Free)

**Track affiliate click-throughs:**

Add GA4 event tracking to all outbound affiliate links:
```javascript
// Add to your layout or tracking component
document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  const link = e.target.closest('a[href*="clio.com"], a[href*="mycase.com"], a[href*="practicepanther"]');
  if (link) {
    gtag('event', 'affiliate_click', {
      'software_name': link.dataset.software || 'unknown',
      'page_path': window.location.pathname,
      'link_url': link.href
    });
  }
});
```

**Or using Next.js data attributes:**
```tsx
<a 
  href={affiliateUrl} 
  data-software={software.name}
  onClick={() => trackAffiliateClick(software.name)}
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
>
  Try {software.name} Free
</a>
```

Create a GA4 custom report:
- Go to **Reports → Custom → Create Report**
- Dimension: Page path
- Metric: Event count (affiliate_click)
- Filter: Event name = affiliate_click

---

### Option B: Simple UTM Tracking (No Code)

Use UTM parameters in your affiliate links:
```
Base: https://www.clio.com
Tracked: https://www.clio.com?utm_source=counselstack&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=review-page
```

Then in GA4, filter by `utm_source = counselstack` to see traffic sent.

---

### Monitoring Conversions Across Programs

| Program | Where to Track |
|---------|----------------|
| Clio | Clio Partner Portal (after approval) |
| MyCase | PartnerStack Dashboard → Analytics |
| PracticePanther | PartnerStack Dashboard → Analytics |
| Lawmatics | Lawmatics Partner Dashboard |
| CosmoLex | Email confirmation per referral |
| TimeSolv | TimeSolv affiliate portal |
| Bill4Time | HasOffers portal (bill4time.hasoffers.com) |

**Check each dashboard weekly.** Most programs update conversion data within 24-72 hours.

---

### Monthly Revenue Tracking Template

Create a spreadsheet with these columns:

```
Month | Program | Clicks | Trials | Conversions | Commission/Conv | Total Earned | Payout Date
------|---------|--------|--------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|------------
Feb   | Clio    | 45     | 8      | 2           | TBD             | TBD          | March
Feb   | MyCase  | 38     | 6      | 1           | $320            | $320         | March 15
Feb   | PP      | 28     | 4      | 1           | $166            | $166         | March 15
Feb   | CosmoLex| 12     | 3      | 1           | $150            | $150         | March 5
```

**Monthly review checklist:**
- [ ] Log into each affiliate dashboard
- [ ] Record clicks, trials, and conversions
- [ ] Note any programs with high clicks but low conversions (update CTA/copy)
- [ ] Check for any pending payouts
- [ ] Update UTM data in GA4
- [ ] Identify top-performing pages (highest affiliate click rate)

- Never let commission influence editorial ratings or rankings
- The review content you've already written is honest — keep it that way
- Mention in reviews that links may be affiliate links

### W-9 Requirement
Most programs require a W-9 (US persons) before paying commissions. Download at:
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf

Fill it out once and save a signed copy to send to multiple programs.

### Payment Threshold
- PartnerStack: $25 minimum before payout
- Most direct programs: $50-100 minimum
- Expect 30-60 days lag from conversion to payout (commission verification period)

### Cookie Duration
- **PartnerStack:** 90 days (standard) — industry best
- **Direct programs:** Varies; ask when you apply
- Clio: Unknown — ask during application
- Longer cookie = more time to convert = more revenue per click
